THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT READY FOR PUBLICATION.  USE IT ONLY IN CONCERT WITH SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW THIS WORKS!!   
Instructions for loading an existing wallet from a secure json keyfile  
and using that address to stake a validator on Pocket’s Mainnet.  
PREREQUISITES AND ASSUMPTIONS:
These instructions begin where https://github.com/BenVanGithub/pokt-validator-configurator/blob/master/README.md ends.  


1. > pocket accounts list 

1. >pocket accounts set-validator <address from list>  
((enter the password))   

1. >pocket start  

1. wait for it to sync  

after synced… stop it with control-C … restart it with:

pocket start --simulateRelay

ETH test (replace "yourDomain.com" with the URL of your Pocket Validator Node)  
         (replace "10.116.0.4" with the IP of an Ethereum Full Node that will accept RPCs)  

``` 
curl -X POST --data '{"chain_url":"http://10.116.0.4:8545","payload":{"data":"{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_getBalance\",\"params\":[\"0xe7a24E61b2ec77d3663ec785d1110688d2A32ecc\", \"latest\"],\"id\":1}","method":"POST","path":"","headers":{}}}' https://yourDomain.com:8081/v1/client/sim 
```

pocket test (replace "yourDomain.com" with the URL of your Pocket Validator Node)  
         (replae "10.116.0.5" with the IP of a Pocket Full Node that will accept RPCs)  

``` 
curl --insecure -X POST --data '{"chain_url":"http://10.116.0.5:8081","payload":{"data":"{}","method":"POST","path":"v1/query/nodes","headers":{}}}' https://yourDomain.com:8081/v1/client/sim
```

Everything is testing good? 
 OK… let’s load up the wallet 


You have two options:  
1.)  copy it up using an FTP program such as filezilla.  
2.)  Create it on the server using “vi” and copy/paste the contents from your local device. 

This document will assume you are using option 2.  If you have already copied up the file using another method, skip to the line that starts…. “pocket accounts import-armored..”

vi .pocket/config/keyfile.json

1.) Open the secure keyfile on your PC wi/Users/cryptoedge/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.th any text editor and copy the entire contents of that file.  
2.) Paste those contents into the keyfile.json which you are currently editing on the server.
3.) save the file.

NOTE: we are using the /Users/cryptoedge/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.path .pocket/config for convenience and consistency… it does not have to be in that specific directory nor have that specific name. 


pocket accounts import-armored .pocket/config/keyfile.json

((enter passphrase then ))…/Users/cryptoedge/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
((enter passphrase again ))…

((Account imported successfully [LongStringOfLettersAndNumbers] ))



pocket accounts set-validator LongStringOfLettersAndNumbersFromAbove

((passphrase then no-output))

Review the chains.json just to make sure everything looks good. In particular make sure you have an entry for id: 0001 and 0021

cat .pocket/config/chains.json

now let’s start this back baby up!
In a separate terminal window. Type:

pocket start
(( Tons of red and green output ))

if stakeing with fresh pocket skip this section 
 if loading funds already in the genesis file then 
Back in the original terminal window type:

pocket nodes unjail LongStringOfLettersAndNumbersFromAbove mainnet 10000
((passphrase then….)
((may fail [code: 4 ] don’t panic.. try again in two minutes))
(( Not sure if this is a timing error or network instability))
(( 4 nodes tested.. 1=4 trys, 2=6 trys 1=1 try ))
(( one worked at first attempt ))
(( success response ends with the below ))

    "raw_log": "[{\"msg_index\":0,\"success\":true,\"log\":\"\",\"events\":[{\"type\":\"message\",\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"action\",\"value\":\"unjail_validator\"}]}]}]",
    "txhash": "4EBA2A29D2CB09AFCB084BF988743092BEF912B5DD6E5D50A4A941522A05946C"
}
pocket query node LongStringOfLettersAndNumbersFromAbove
(( requires a block confirmation could take up to 15 minutes ))
(( look for…  ))
"jailed": false,


pocket query balance LongStringOfLettersAndNumbersFromAbove

(( "balance": 990000 … or some similar number ))


ALL Happy and Joy???
good.
let’s remove the secure keyfile that we created or uploaded earlier…
No point in leaving it there (it’s encrypted but still, better safe than sorry)

rm .pocket/config/keyfile.json
(( no output ))
